//We come to the thrilling finale of our "Tech Writing against Word" pencraft drama.
Get ready for another thrilling episode of our "Documentation Chronicles" pencraft drama, "Tech Writing Against Word"
It's man versus machine.
Old Doc Writer, author of three books on Java and captain of the tech tutorial team, is tasked to produce another demystifying masterpiece.
Just around the next turn, a glitchy, cumbersome word processor lies in wait.

"Well, old fella, it's time for me to get writing again.
I've got my notes at my left side and my bourbon on the right.
By morning, I should have this manuscript licked good."

Taking a swig of his drink, he gets down to business.
But before our prolific hero can make it through the headline, the word processor begins foiling his plans.

Like Goldilocks, it seems Old Doc is trying to find a zoom that feels just right.
Enough to see the big picture, but not so much he has to squint.
At last, he seems to have found a setting that works for him.

// format document title, format author name, use field for author name
With a better view, he's still not happy with the look of the headline.
It's those darn smart quotes.
If only he could locate the hidden switch that activates their intelligence.
He's found it!

Oh no, it looks like he's fallen trap to the font selector.
That's going to come back to bite him later.
...or sooner, from the look of where he's headed.
This is a tricky road you don't want to venture down, folks.

Having had enough with all the fiddling, he's finally getting into the content.
Look at that!
The tool is anticipating his next word, but doesn't seem to want to give it up.
Annoyed by this taunting, Doc meanders again through the labyrinth of cascading menus to find reprieve.

It's stop and go back at the helm, as he lashes back and forth between writing and formatting.
Each setting seems to stick and trip him up.

////
He's on to the first section, only to find himself once again enticed by the options.
It looks like this time he's discovered the style tool.
He circles back and fixes up his styles, polishes off some blank line debris and once again returns to writing.
////

Distraction doesn't stay away long for Old Doc.
On to the first section, he's fallen victim to the bullets and numbering trap.
//He's fallen victim to the bullets and numbering formatting trap.
We'll take this opportunity for a brief message from our sponsor.

And we're back...to more peril.
The hits just keep on coming.
If it's not one thing, it's another.
Doc is trying to make a warning to his reader, but perhaps he's the one who needs to be warned.
The sun's going to be up before he completes this page.

Oh no, now he faces the herculean task of inserting source code.
Back to the labyrinth of menus and dialog windows he goes.
This could take days.
It's not looking good for Old Doc Writer.
Can the book be saved?

Fear not.
This is a job for Asciidoctor.
Get prepared for some real action.

Our hero kicks his word processor to the curb and calls up his good 'ol fashioned text editor.

Here comes the headline again.
Now followed by the byline.
Throw in a toc for extra credit.
By golly, look at him go!

Without the distractions in his way, he's sailing over the inline markup like a true pro.
There are no bandits laying in wait around these corners.

Hold on, he's coming up on the first bulleted list.
Does it slow him down?
No sir-ee.
He cuts through it like a warm knife in butter.

And how about the source code?
No problem there.
He just pastes it right in.
Incredible.

But, wait! What's this?
Oh, look at that!
He's annotating the code.
That's surely going to add some utility.
//He's gonna extract it directly from the code instead.
//That's surely going to save him time on the next go around.

There you have it, folks.
Thanks to AsciiDoc, our hero has discovered writing zen.

Ohhh, ladies and gentlemen, let me give you a little inside information.

These office suites are raking you and your content over the coals.

You've got tools the size of cathedrals that work in opposition of getting anything written down.
Then you stuff those binary balls of content into email and infest the web with them like a mutating virus.
Portable content?
Ha!

The next generation is right around the corner, folks.
They're carrying around computers in their back pocket!
It's an adaptive world out there.
It's time for your content to adapt or die.

Word and PowerPoint are relics of the past.
You gotta look into the future.
Lightweight markup languages are in it.

Give me some AsciiDoc.
Hoo ha!

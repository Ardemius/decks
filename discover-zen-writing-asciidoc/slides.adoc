TODO:

- add mobile screenshot of Asciidoctor website (or other Asciidoctor-styled sample app)
- add AsciiDoc on JavaScript slide to cover Opal, show off docgist or graphgist
- add slide to cover stylesheet factory, "Asciidoctor Foundation"
- add slide for *this* presentation

- add link to sample asciidoc/markdown/docbook documents
- use labeled list (perhaps horizontal) to make DocBook even more verbose
- rework or rethink "Inside Out" slide
